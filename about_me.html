      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Technology has been always been big part of my life. Whether I was watching TV, using a computer, or playing video games, technology always interested me. I was curious as to how everything truly worked, and in fact, it was my love for video games specifically that led me down a path of wanting to learn how to program my own, which eventually developed into a greater passion for technology as a whole.</p>
