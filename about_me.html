      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Technology has been always been big part of my life. Whether I was watching TV, using a computer, or playing video games, technology always interested me. I was curious as to how everything truly worked, and in fact, it was my love for video games specifically that led me down a path of wanting to learn how to program my own, which eventually developed into a greater passion for technology as a whole.</p>

      <p>When it came to learning how to program, it was mostly me teaching myself through online resources like YouTube videos. After entering high school, I took Computer Science courses from Grade 10 and onwards, which not only helped me learn the fundamentals of programming but also gave me a proper classroom environment where I could learn with other people. After high school, I ended up joining the Information Technology program at York University, and it is where I currently am.</p>
